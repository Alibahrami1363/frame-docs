## How to get Ether on Frame

**Note: These are instructions for getting Ether onto Frame's testnet.** We will update these docs when we are closer to mainnet.

Becuase Frame is a rollup, it uses **Ether** as its native currency.

The Frame testnet is built on top of [Sepolia](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/sepolia-testnet) (transactions will settle to Sepolia).
In order to receive Ether on Frame, you will need to get Sepolia Ether and bridge it to Frame testnet.

In order to get Sepolia ETH, you can use one of the following resources:

- https://faucet.quicknode.com/arbitrum/sepolia
- https://sepoliafaucet.com/
- https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/

Once you've received your Sepolia Ether, you can bridge it to Frame using our [native bridge](https://www.frame.xyz/bridge).
