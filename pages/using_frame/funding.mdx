## How to get Ether on Frame

**Note: These are instructions for getting Ether onto Frame's testnet.** We will update these docs when we are closer to mainnet.

Becuase Frame is a rollup, it uses **Ether** as its native currency.

The Frame testnet is built on top of [Sepolia](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/sepolia-testnet) (transactions will settle to Sepolia).
In order to receive Ether on Frame, you can use a direct Frame faucet or get Sepolia Ether and bridge it to Frame testnet.

To get Frame testnet ETH directly, you can use this faucet:

- https://faucet.triangleplatform.com/frame/testnet

In order to get Sepolia ETH, you can use one of the following resources:

- https://faucet.quicknode.com/arbitrum/sepolia
- https://sepoliafaucet.com/
- https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/

Once you've received your Sepolia Ether, you can bridge it to Frame using our [native bridge](https://www.frame.xyz/bridge).
